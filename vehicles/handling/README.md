## Mass & Weight

- **`fMass`**: Determines the weight of the vehicle. Higher values result in a heavier vehicle, affecting acceleration and handling.
  
- **`fInitialDragCoeff`**: Controls air resistance affecting top speed and acceleration.
  
- **`fPercentSubmerged`**: Indicates how submerged the vehicle must be before it floats (applies to boats and vehicles in water).

- **`vecCentreOfMassOffset`**: Adjusts the vehicle’s center of mass in X, Y, and Z axes.

- **`vecInertiaMultiplier`**: Controls inertia for roll, pitch, and yaw. Lower values reduce the tendency to roll over.

---

## Aerodynamics

- **`fInitialDragCoeff`**: Sets the drag coefficient, affecting how much air resistance the vehicle experiences.

- **`fDownforceModifier`**: Influences how much downforce is generated by the car’s aerodynamic components. Higher values create more downforce, increasing traction at high speeds.

---

## Transmission & Gears

- **`nInitialDriveGears`**: Defines the number of gears in the vehicle’s transmission.

- **`fInitialDriveMaxFlatVel`**: The maximum flat velocity the vehicle can achieve (in meters per second).

- **`fClutchChangeRateScaleUpShift` & `fClutchChangeRateScaleDownShift`**: Define how quickly the vehicle shifts gears up and down.

---

## Acceleration & Drive Force

- **`fInitialDriveForce`**: Sets the force applied to the wheels for acceleration. Higher values make the car accelerate faster.

- **`fDriveInertia`**: Determines how smooth or sharp the car's acceleration is. Higher values make acceleration more linear.

- **`fInitialDriveMaxFlatVel`**: Sets the maximum flat speed the vehicle can reach.

---

## Braking & Steering

- **`fBrakeForce`**: Determines the vehicle’s braking power. Higher values result in stronger braking.

- **`fBrakeBiasFront`**: Adjusts how much of the braking force is applied to the front or rear wheels.

- **`fHandBrakeForce`**: Defines the strength of the handbrake. Useful for drifting.

- **`fSteeringLock`**: The maximum angle the wheels can turn.

---

## Traction & Grip

- **`fTractionCurveMax`**: Maximum grip when cornering at high speeds.

- **`fTractionCurveMin`**: Minimum grip when cornering at low speeds.

- **`fTractionBiasFront`**: Adjusts traction balance between the front and rear wheels.

- **`fTractionLossMult`**: Controls how much grip is lost in various situations like sharp turns or drifting.

- **`fLowSpeedTractionLossMult`**: Determines how much grip is lost at low speeds, useful for off-road vehicles.

---

## Suspension Settings

- **`fSuspensionForce`**: Sets the stiffness of the suspension. Higher values reduce body roll but can make the ride harsher.

- **`fSuspensionCompDamp`**: Compression damping, which controls how quickly the suspension compresses.

- **`fSuspensionReboundDamp`**: Rebound damping, which controls how quickly the suspension returns to its normal state after compression.

- **`fSuspensionUpperLimit` & `fSuspensionLowerLimit`**: Set the range of motion for the suspension. Negative values allow more downward movement.

- **`fSuspensionBiasFront`**: Adjusts the suspension balance between the front and rear. Lower values make the front suspension stiffer.

---

## Damage Parameters

- **`fCollisionDamageMult`**: Multiplier for collision damage. Lower values reduce damage from crashes.

- **`fWeaponDamageMult`**: Multiplier for damage caused by weapons (e.g., guns).

- **`fDeformationDamageMult`**: Controls how much the vehicle deforms in a collision. Higher values result in more visible damage.

- **`fEngineDamageMult`**: Affects how much damage the engine takes.

---

## SubHandlingData

### Cars

- **`fBackEndPopUpCarImpulseMult`**: Controls the tendency for the back end of the car to pop up when accelerating or braking hard.

- **`fToeFront` & `fToeRear`**: Adjust the toe-in or toe-out angle of the front and rear wheels, influencing cornering behavior.

- **`fCamberFront` & `fCamberRear`**: Define the camber of the front and rear wheels. Negative camber increases grip when cornering.

---

### Motorcycles

- **`fLeanFwdForceMult` & `fLeanBakForceMult`**: Control the forward and backward leaning force, affecting wheelies and stoppies.

- **`fMaxBankAngle`**: Maximum bank angle when cornering.

- **`fWheelieBalancePoint` & `fStoppieBalancePoint`**: Control the balance point for performing wheelies or stoppies.

---

### Boats

- **`fPropRadius`**: The size of the boat’s propeller, affecting its power and speed.

- **`fRudderOffset`**: Controls how the boat steers by adjusting the rudder's angle.

- **`fWavePushMult`**: Multiplier for how much the boat is affected by waves.

---

### Helicopters

- **`fRotorForce`**: Controls the lift generated by the helicopter’s rotor. Higher values allow for faster ascents.

- **`fTailRotorForce`**: Determines the force generated by the tail rotor for steering.

- **`fYawMult`**: Controls how quickly the helicopter turns on its vertical axis.

---

### Planes

- **`fThrust`**: The force generated by the engine for acceleration.

- **`fMaxLiftVelocity`**: Determines the maximum velocity at which the plane generates lift.

- **`fRollForce`**: Controls the force applied when rolling the plane left or right.

---

## Other Parameters

- **`AIHandling`**: Defines how AI will handle the vehicle. Possible values include "AVERAGE", "SPORTS_CAR", or "TRUCK".

- **`strModelFlags`**: Various flags that influence vehicle behavior (e.g., 440010).

- **`strHandlingFlags`**: Additional handling flags that modify vehicle behavior (e.g., 101).

- **`strDamageFlags`**: Flags that control how the vehicle behaves when damaged.

- **`fPetrolTankVolume`**: Defines the volume of the vehicle's fuel tank.

- **`fOilVolume`**: Defines the volume of the oil tank.
